# Boards

* SDS011 Library [link](https://github.com/lewapek/sds-dust-sensors-arduino-library) - via Library Manager of Arduino IDE
* Ed25519 - from here https://github.com/rweather/arduinolibs

There is no Ed25519 in Arduino Library Manager so the only way to get Ed25519 is to place `Crypto` folder to `~/Arduino/libraries`
